Example using sbt-assembly
==========================
This example makes use of the [sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) plugin to build a fat JAR file.

Build the image by running `sbt docker` in this directory.

Then run the produced image with the following command `docker run -i sbt-docker/example-assembly-simple`
