Example with sbt-native-packager
================================

This example makes use of the [sbt-native-packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) plugin to build a
Java application package (`JavaAppPackaging`).

Build a new image by running `sbt docker` in this directory.

Then run the produced image with `docker run -i sbtdocker/example-sbt-native-packager`.
